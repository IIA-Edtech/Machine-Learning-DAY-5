# Machine Learning Jupyter Notebook files 

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook files for data science that has content on Gradient Boost, a template for a Project Notebook and Model Evaluation. 
These python files are designed to help you run and understand simple codes on machine learning  models such as Gradient Boost. You will learn how to evaluate Models and also understand how a project should be structured.

## Notebook Files
This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook files:

- **Gradient Boost Template:** This notebook file provides a starting point for the construction of a Gradient Boost classification model in Python. The notebook includes code for loading packages, importing data, doing EDA, constructing and evaluating the model.

- **Project Notebook:** This notebook provides a project notebook template that is used to improve logical workflow.

- **Model Evaluation:** This notebook provides useful functions that follow the workflow of a train, validate, test model development process. The functions make it easy to view model results at any stage of the process as well as aggregate results into a dataframe for model comparison.
